# Step-by-step Action Plan for creating this application:
- Designate one 'GitHub Manager' to clone this repository on their personal GitHub account.
- Break into 4 groups.  Each group should designate one person to be the 'Branch Manager.'
- Each 'Branch Manager' should fork the 'GitHub Manager's' repository to their own GitHub.
- Each 'Branch Manager' should clone their forked copy of the repository to their local machine.
- Each 'Branch Manager' should create a branch on their local repository, naming it after the functionality the group is in charge of.
- One group should write the code for the index page, including a link to the 'details' page for an event, a link to the 'add an event' page, and a delete button for each event.
- One group should write the code for the 'add event' page.
- One group should write the code for the 'details' page, which should include a field/button to add an attendee to an event as well as link to the 'update' page.
- One group should write the code for the 'update' page, which should allow the user to update an event and redirect back to the event details page.

## Hints:
- Don't forget to install your node packages after cloning the repository!
- Talk with each other about naming convention so that file names align properly.
- Don't forget to checkout to a branch before beginning your work.  Don't make changes directly to the master branch!!!
